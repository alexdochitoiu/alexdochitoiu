## Hey there 👋

🧔 My name is **Alex** and I am a **Full Stack Developer** with a strong passion for front-end development. 

💻 I'm all about creating **intuitive UIs** and building **scalable code** that not only looks good but also performs like a charm 🚀. 

👨‍💻 I'm a big believer in **clean code and architecture**, but I also understand the importance of maintaining the balance between code quality and timely feature delivery.

🌱 I'm always exploring new technologies and methodologies by reading blogs, articles, and tech books to deliver cutting-edge solutions.

🎓 I hold a **Bachelor's degree in Computer Science**, which laid the foundation for my career.

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 I'm a husband and dad of two little angels 👼, and I adore spending time with my family. We also have a furry companion, a bichon maltese dog! 🐕

🎣 My hobbies include football, movies, predator fishing, traveling, and spending time in nature. And of course, coding is one of my favorite activities.
